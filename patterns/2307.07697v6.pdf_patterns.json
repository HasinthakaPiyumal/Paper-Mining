    "Pattern Name": "LLM as Knowledge Graph Agent",
    "Problem": "Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently suffer from hallucinations, struggle with specialized or outdated knowledge, lack transparency, and perform poorly in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks. Existing LLM-KG integration methods often treat LLMs as mere translators or augmenters, rather than active reasoners, which limits their ability to fully leverage structured knowledge and provide explainable decisions.",
    "Context": "AI systems that demand deep, responsible, and verifiable reasoning over factual knowledge, where the inherent limitations of LLMs (knowledge gaps, hallucination) and the structured nature of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) need to be synergistically combined.",
    "Solution": "Design the LLM to function as an intelligent agent that actively and interactively explores, reasons, and makes dynamic decisions on a Knowledge Graph. Instead of simply receiving pre-retrieved facts or translating queries, the LLM directly guides the search and reasoning process step-by-step on the KG, dynamically discovering relevant entities and relations.",
    "Result": "Significantly enhances LLMs' deep reasoning capabilities, mitigates hallucination by grounding responses in verifiable facts, improves knowledge traceability and explainability, and allows for more flexible and efficient knowledge updates. This approach can also enable smaller LLMs to achieve performance competitive with larger models in knowledge-intensive tasks.",

    "Pattern Name": "LLM-Guided Iterative Knowledge Graph Exploration (ThinkonGraph)",
    "Problem": "Effectively navigating and extracting multi-hop reasoning paths from large and complex Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for LLM-based reasoning is challenging, as direct query formulation is often insufficient and brute-force search is inefficient. A key challenge is to ensure that the most relevant information is prioritized in the exploration process.",
    "Context": "AI systems that utilize LLMs to answer complex questions or execute reasoning tasks requiring the synthesis of information from multiple entities and relations within a Knowledge Graph. The system needs to dynamically discover and refine relevant reasoning paths.",
    "Solution": "Implement an iterative beam search mechanism on the Knowledge Graph, where a Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the intelligent decision-making agent at each step. This process involves:\n1.  **Initialization:** The LLM identifies initial topic entities from the input question to begin the search.\n2.  **Iterative Exploration:** In each iteration, the LLM performs a two-step 'Search and Prune' process:\n    *   **Relation Exploration:** Search for all neighboring relations from the current tail entities of the top-N paths. The LLM then 'prunes' these candidates by scoring and selecting the most relevant relations to extend the paths.\n    *   **Entity Exploration:** Based on the selected relations, search for candidate tail entities. The LLM then 'prunes' these entities by scoring and selecting the most relevant ones to form new top-N reasoning paths.\n3.  **Reasoning/Evaluation:** After each exploration step, the LLM evaluates whether the current set of top-N reasoning paths is sufficient to answer the question. If so, it generates the answer; otherwise, it continues iterating or falls back to its inherent knowledge if the maximum search depth is reached.\n**Variant (ToGR):** For increased efficiency, the entity pruning step can be replaced with random sampling, thereby focusing more on relation chains and reducing LLM calls.",
    "Result": "Enables LLMs to dynamically extract diverse and multi-hop reasoning paths, significantly enhancing deep reasoning capabilities for knowledge-intensive tasks. Improves efficiency by guiding the search with LLM intelligence and allows for flexible integration of different LLMs and KGs.",

    "Pattern Name": "Knowledge Traceability and Correctability via Explicit Reasoning Paths",
    "Problem": "Large Language Models often produce opaque answers, making it difficult to understand the provenance of information, diagnose errors (e.g., hallucinations or outdated facts), and build user trust. Furthermore, correcting internal LLM knowledge is an expensive and time-consuming process.",
    "Context": "AI systems where transparency, explainability, verifiability, and the ability to diagnose and correct knowledge-related errors are critical. This pattern is particularly relevant when combining LLMs with external knowledge sources like Knowledge Graphs.",
    "Solution": "The AI system is designed to generate and expose the explicit reasoning paths (e.g., sequences of triples from a Knowledge Graph) that were used by the LLM to arrive at its answer. These paths serve as verifiable evidence. If an answer is questioned or found incorrect by users, experts, or other AI systems, the explicit path enables:\n*   **Tracing:** Pinpointing the exact knowledge triples or inference steps that led to the output.\n*   **Diagnosis:** Identifying erroneous, outdated, or missing information within the KG, or issues in the LLM's interpretation/reasoning.\n*   **Correction:** Facilitating human or automated correction of the identified faulty knowledge (e.g., updating triples in the KG, a process referred to as 'knowledge infusion'), thereby improving the system and its underlying knowledge base.",
    "Result": "Enhances the explainability and transparency of LLM reasoning, builds user trust, enables efficient debugging and correction of knowledge errors, and contributes to the continuous improvement and quality assurance of underlying Knowledge Graphs.",
